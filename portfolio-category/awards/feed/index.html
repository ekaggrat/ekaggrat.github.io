<p>The ‘SPIRE ’which literally means a spiral, was inspired from the movement of the Japanese folding fan. The hour and the minute hands of this clock constrain the spiral form at two ends. The spiral form of the clock unfolds and folds in the rhythm of a Japanese fan.</p>
<p>Time on the SPIRE is displayed by a play of mass and void. The base houses all the mechatronics required to run the clock. The base and the blades of the clock can be made from various combination of materials such as copper, stainless steel, wood, acrylic</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>..The joy of making paper pops lead us to explore a system that could provide us with multiplicity of possibilities. The basic principle of pop ups, folding-unfolding got transformed into a system of a<br />
form-shifting panel, which could be executed in a real life situation. The basic principle that has been worked out can be applied in various situations by changing the scale, size and number of elements in the panel. Hence in one scale it is a interior element which can transform into furniture, a niche wall etc.. At another scale it could be used as a external skin to a built form which can change its form and creates a play of light and shadows. At yet another scale it could become a toy, a form shifting sculpture etc. The advantage of using stainless steel for the panel is that it gives a clean, durable product and the material itself becomes the finish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shijilong ski resort sits at the base of a large mountain with imposing viewof the mountains to the north andthe valley to the south. The building is conceived as a gateway to the majestic ski slope and mountains in the background. The dark colored roofs make the building stand out in the snow covered mountains. Large glazed windows and pitch roofs open up the building to the breath taking views on the north and the south.</p>
<p>The project is a facelift to a previous dilapidated old ski resort which existed and functioned for a little over 10 years. The Idea was to retain the basic structure of the building and to add on to it without damaging much of the core concrete structure. Spaces were added to the first and second floor using light weight steel structure.</p>
<p>The interior of the resort were kept minimal and mimic a rustic industrial look. The original concrete and the roofing is kept bare and very basic work is done just to make it comfortable and usable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Role : concept design , design development. ( interior and exterior )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a proposal for a roof top restaurant for a franchise called mocha.. The roof top restaurant is a part of a restaurant cum banquet hall which is being constructed in a existing shopping complex. The first floor of the project consists of a banquet cum exhibition hall. The terrace of the building will house two restaurants of which this is one.The restaurant is partly covered and partly open. The covered part is air conditioned. The idea behind the design was to have a light weight metal structure suspended from the steel girders which frame it. The warped surface is basically a sheet metal structure with frames at regular intervals.</p>
<p>The covered part of the restaurant houses 30 people and the uncovered part houses another 30. The structure is still in proposal stage and will be constructed as soon as the necessary clearances are given. The project has been done in collaboration with a local architect who is designing and executing the rest of the project.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This wall was developed as a part of a high end villa in ahmedabad. The wall was made to serve as a partition between the family dinning room and the adjoining bar. It was the requirement of the client to have a partition that could be moved when required to give a larger space for parties. Also being the bar was needed to be hidden when not in use. The wall opens up in 3 stages depending on the need of the space when required.</p>

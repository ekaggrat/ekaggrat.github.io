				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The requirement of the client was to quickly build a temporary installation in the courtyard in front of the sales office to redefine the relationship between the site and the building and the environment, and to re-arrange the sequence of the functions . The client needed the building to be completely dismantled after a set time period. The building reflects a &#8220;lightness&#8221;; characteristic, which is in an interesting contrast with the heavy feeling embodied in the current building. Calvino said: &#8220;Lightness is in line with precision and firmness, not vagueness and randomness.&#8221;; Here, lightness means that the structural stress system is displayed more honestly, and the bearing capacity of the material is more efficiently utilized.The solution we think of is &#8212; scaffolding, the kind of standard scaffold that is used on all sites. Its features, such as light weight, quick disassembly, reusable, modular, etc., all respond well to&#8221;lightness&#8221;; and, of course, perfectly meet clients stringent requirements for project budgets and schedules. All we have to do is use this material to build a temporary structure that will allow it to exist lightly in the site and form a dialogue with the current environment so as to promote the improvement of the relationship between the various parts of the current environment. An<br />
interesting idea emerged was to temporarily “disappear” the existing building, and the lightweight scaffolding device will temporarily replace its location and form a new interaction with the natural environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The project was done as a prototypical unit for the 2017 china solar decathalon . We were hired by the participating team to do the architectural design aspect of the unit. The unit was to be 3d printed on the bam machine and hence was designed to be in segments for easy transport and assembly. The use of 3d printing gave us the freedom to custom macke every piece. I was responsible for the entire concept design phaze.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shijilong ski resort sits at the base of a large mountain with imposing viewof the mountains to the north andthe valley to the south. The building is conceived as a gateway to the majestic ski slope and mountains in the background. The dark colored roofs make the building stand out in the snow covered mountains. Large glazed windows and pitch roofs open up the building to the breath taking views on the north and the south.</p>
<p>The project is a facelift to a previous dilapidated old ski resort which existed and functioned for a little over 10 years. The Idea was to retain the basic structure of the building and to add on to it without damaging much of the core concrete structure. Spaces were added to the first and second floor using light weight steel structure.</p>
<p>The interior of the resort were kept minimal and mimic a rustic industrial look. The original concrete and the roofing is kept bare and very basic work is done just to make it comfortable and usable.</p>

<p>Role : concept design , design development. ( interior and exterior )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>V-link is a franchise run by vanke which is more or less like a commercially run community center with amenities like day care center, classrooms , conference centers and food courts. The v- link is located in chanchun ( china ) and acts as a gateway to the residential community which lies behind it. As the region is extremely cold in winter most of the activities are enclosed around the heated atrium. Even the street shops have a indoor street to help people shop indoors in the winter. The form of the building was choosen to continue the style of a existing reception center of the project constructed a few years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The Admiral mall is located in the city of Nanning in south China. The mall being 10 years old needed a change of the entire facade. The client had a strange request of making the south facade look like a ship. This gave rise to the challenging facade which is made to look like a ship floating in water. The top of the facade is made up of reflective stainless panels and the bottom flowing</div>
<div>water is made out of triangles of glass and aluminum . The rear part of the ship is made to look like it is disintegrating. The complex shape of the facade was designed and modelled by me in Rhino using a lot of grasshopper scripts. After the model was approved I generated the drawings using a mix of grasshopper scripts and manual projection drawing. After a certain stage the model was transferred to the facade company to generate the shop drawings and construct it.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The City of Wuhan is a very fast growing city in the central China. This master plan is a part of the phase 3 of the city development plan. Phaze 1 of the master plan consists of office park for a infrastructure developer consisting of functions related to design and development of large scale development functions. The idea behind the master plan was to run a artificial stream though the various plats to create a linkage between them. Since Wuhan has heavy rains most of the year and is a city of lakes it is easy to sustain the waterbody.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My role in this project is to develop the entire master plan and design the main office blocks.</div>

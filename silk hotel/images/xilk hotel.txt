The Xilk hotel is conceived as a 500-key hotel for a developer in Wuhan, Central China. The complex consists of a 3-star hotel and an office block with other supporting functions. The site of the project is a very long rectangle. Hence the hotel block was spread across the site and kept low in height to take advantage of this long site."
